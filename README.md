# Cardiomyocyte-Fusion

## About
In this study, we investigated the origin and genomic-transcriptomic repertoire of polyploid cardiomyocytes in the human heart using single-nucleus multiomic data. Using single-nucleus whole genome sequencing, 10x Genomics snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq techniques, we revealed the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of polyploid cardiomyocytes. We found that higher-ploidy cardiomyocytes could result from fusion with other cell types. All imaging data from heart are deposited [here]. Step-by-step analysis procedures are described [here](/docs/Workflow.md), and the associated scripts and data are deposited. The data includes gene expression levels, chromatin state annotations, and Hi-C chromatin interactions. The raw data sets can be obtained from [dbGaP]() through requests, and other processed files can be downloaded from the supplementary tables of the following paper.
